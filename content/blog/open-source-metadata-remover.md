When you use a tool to remove sensitive data from your files, you're placing a lot of trust in that tool. How do you know it's actually stripping the metadata and not uploading your files to a server somewhere? With a closed-source tool, you can't. You're taking the developer's word for it.

With an open-source metadata remover, you don't have to.

PrivMeta is a free, open-source metadata remover that runs entirely in your browser. Drop in your files, strip the metadata, download the clean version. No upload, no account, no black box.

## What "Open Source" Actually Means for a Privacy Tool

Open source means the source code is publicly available. Anyone can read it, inspect it, and verify exactly what the software does. For a privacy tool that handles sensitive files, that distinction matters enormously.

PrivMeta's full source code is [on GitHub](https://github.com/DScaife/privmeta/tree/master). You, or any developer you trust, can audit every line that touches your files. No trust required beyond what you can verify yourself.

## Three Things You Can Verify in the Code

**1. Files never leave your browser**

PrivMeta processes files using JavaScript running directly in your browser tab. There are no API calls to external servers, no cloud processing endpoints, no upload functions hidden in the codebase. You can confirm this by reading the source.

**2. Metadata is actually removed**

Different file types need different approaches. For images, PrivMeta strips EXIF, IPTC, and XMP segments. For DOCX files, it removes the `docProps/` XML files from the ZIP archive. For audio and video, it uses FFmpeg compiled to WebAssembly, running locally in your browser, not on a server. The code for each format is readable on GitHub.

**3. Nothing is tracked on your end**

Some tools claim to be private while embedding analytics that log file types, sizes, or usage timestamps. With PrivMeta's code public, what is and isn't collected is verifiable, not just a policy claim.

## Who This Matters For

Open source is especially important for people with higher-stakes privacy needs:

**Journalists and researchers** working with sensitive documents need to know that removing identifying information from a source's file actually removes it, not that the tool says it does.

**Activists and whistleblowers** need to be able to verify, or have a trusted technical contact verify, that a tool is safe to use before trusting it with files that could identify people.

**Developers and security professionals** routinely audit tools before recommending them to clients or colleagues. A closed-source metadata remover is a black box; an open-source one is an auditable system.

**Privacy-conscious users** who simply want to understand what a piece of software does before trusting it with their personal files.

## Open Source + Client-Side: Why the Combination Matters

Open source and client-side processing are a particularly powerful combination for a metadata remover.

Even if PrivMeta's code were open source but processed files on a server, you'd be trusting that the server was running the same code you reviewed on GitHub, with no way to verify it. With client-side processing, what runs in your browser *is* the code on GitHub. There's no server in between where something different could be happening.

This is the core design decision behind PrivMeta: the code is public, and the processing happens where you can see it.

## How to Use This Open Source Metadata Remover

No account or installation needed:

1. Go to [PrivMeta](/)
2. Drop your files into the dropzone
3. Click **Remove metadata**
4. Download the cleaned files

PrivMeta supports batch processing. You can drop multiple files at once and download them as a ZIP. Everything stays local. You can even use PrivMeta offline after the initial page load, since all processing is in-browser.

## Supported File Types

PrivMeta removes metadata from:

- **Images**: JPEG, PNG, WEBP, GIF, including GPS coordinates, camera model, and timestamps
- **Documents**: PDF, DOCX, including author name, revision history, and company details
- **Video**: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, WEBM, including device info and creation dates
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, M4A, including encoder tags and recording metadata

## A Note on Trust in Privacy Tools

The privacy tool space has a recurring pattern: services that handle sensitive files and make strong privacy claims, but operate as closed-source cloud products. You upload your file, they process it server-side, and you receive a cleaned version. The claim is that nothing is retained. The reality is that you cannot verify this.

Open source doesn't automatically make a tool trustworthy. The code still needs to be well-written and actively maintained. But it is a necessary baseline for serious privacy use cases. It shifts the question from "do you trust this company's privacy policy?" to "can you read the code?"

PrivMeta was built with this in mind. The processing is local, the code is public, and there are no accounts that could tie your file activity to an identity.
