Audio files are often overlooked when people think about metadata privacy. Images get most of the attention, EXIF data and GPS coordinates especially, but your MP3s, FLACs, and podcast recordings carry their own set of hidden tags that can reveal more than you'd expect.

## What Metadata Do Audio Files Contain?

Audio metadata is stored in tags embedded in the file. Different formats use different tag systems, but the most common are **ID3** (used by MP3), **Vorbis comments** (FLAC, OGG), and **iTunes atoms** (M4A, AAC).

Common metadata fields across audio formats include:

### Creative/Publishing Tags
- **Title**: the track or recording name
- **Artist and Album Artist**: the named creator(s)
- **Album**: the release or collection name
- **Track number and disc number**
- **Genre** and **Year**
- **Composer**, **Lyricist**, **Publisher**
- **Comment**: free-text notes field, often used by recording software

### Technical Tags
- **Encoder**: the software used to encode or export the file (e.g. "LAME 3.100", "Logic Pro X", "Audacity 3.4.2")
- **Encoding settings**: bit rate, compression settings, sample rate used at export
- **Length** and **BPM**

### Privacy-Relevant Tags
- **Recording date/time**: when the audio was captured or encoded
- **Recording location**: some DAWs and field recorders embed GPS coordinates
- **Originator reference**: a unique identifier used in broadcast WAV (BWF) files that can tie a recording to a specific device
- **Replay Gain**: can reveal the mastering chain used

### Embedded Content
- **Album artwork**: embedded JPEG images (which may themselves contain EXIF data)
- **Lyrics**
- **Chapter markers** (common in podcasts)

## Which Audio Formats Store Metadata?

| Format | Tag System | Privacy Risk |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| MP3 | ID3v2 | Encoder name, date, comments |
| FLAC | Vorbis Comments | Flexible, often verbose |
| WAV (BWF) | BEXT chunk + ID3 | Originator ID, timestamps |
| AAC / M4A | iTunes atoms | Encoder, purchase info |
| OGG Vorbis | Vorbis Comments | Encoder, date |
| AIFF | ID3 | Similar to MP3 |

## Real Privacy Concerns with Audio Metadata

### Identifying Recording Software

The **Encoder** tag often reveals the exact version of the software used to create the file. This can expose which digital audio workstation (DAW) or codec you use, and potentially which platform you're on.

### Broadcast WAV Originator IDs

Professional audio recorders (field recorders, broadcast equipment) write a **BEXT chunk** into WAV files with an **Originator Reference**, a 32-character string that often encodes the device serial number, date, and time. This is specifically designed to be unique per recording and device, making it trivial to link multiple recordings to the same equipment.

### Podcast and Field Recordings

If you record interviews, podcasts, or audio documentaries, your files may contain the recording date, location metadata from your phone's recorder app, and encoder information, all invisible to listeners but readable by anyone who downloads the file.

### Music Distribution

When distributing music through platforms, some metadata fields are publicly visible in licensing databases. Ensure your encoder tag and comment fields don't contain internal project names, client references, or private notes.

## How to Remove Metadata from Audio Files

### PrivMeta. Private, Client-Side Processing

PrivMeta uses FFmpeg (running locally in your browser via WebAssembly) to strip metadata from audio files without re-encoding them. The audio quality is preserved exactly:

**Supported formats:** MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, OGG, M4A

1. Visit [PrivMeta](/)
2. Drop your audio files into the upload area
3. Click **Remove metadata**
4. Download the cleaned files

Because everything runs in your browser, your audio never leaves your device, which matters if you're working with unreleased music, confidential interviews, or sensitive recordings.

### Command Line (FFmpeg)

For batch processing:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -map_metadata -1 -c copy output.mp3
```

The `-map_metadata -1` flag removes all metadata streams. The `-c copy` flag copies the audio stream without re-encoding, preserving quality.

### MP3Tag (Windows/macOS)

MP3Tag is a free desktop tag editor. Select your files, select all tags, and delete. It supports MP3, FLAC, OGG, and more.

## What About Embedded Album Art?

Embedded album artwork images can themselves contain EXIF data (photographer name, software, copyright). When PrivMeta strips audio metadata using `-map_metadata -1`, the embedded artwork is also removed as part of the metadata stream.

If you need to keep artwork but still protect privacy, you can re-attach a clean version of the image (stripped through PrivMeta's image cleaner first) after the audio metadata is removed.

## When to Remove Audio Metadata

- Before distributing unreleased recordings to collaborators
- Before uploading field recordings or oral history interviews
- Before sharing podcast episode files directly (not via a hosting platform)
- Before submitting audio to clients when encoder/software details are confidential
- When anonymising audio evidence or testimony recordings

If you also need to strip metadata from video files, see our guide on [removing metadata from video files](/blog/remove-metadata-from-video-guide). MP4, MOV, AVI, and more, all processed in-browser.
